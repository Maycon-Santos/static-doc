# Getting started

This is a app to make easily the document write and read for the other users.

## Install

**Using yarn:**

```shell
yarn add static-doc
```

**Using npm:**

```shell
npm install static-doc
```

## Configure scripts (optional)

Insert these commands into your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "docs:dev": "static-doc dev",
  "docs:build": "static-doc build",
  "docs:serve": "static-doc build && static-doc start"
}
```

By default your documents should be in the doc folder at the root of the project, but this can be changed by passing a directory as an argument. Example: `static-doc dev ./my-docs`

## Docs directory

Here will be the .mdx and .md files that will be interpreted will generate the pages. See an example file:

```yaml
---
title: Hello world
name: My first doc
---
# Hello world

This is an example file!
```

What is between the dashes are page properties, [see more here](/page-properties).

## Configuration

You may need to change the logo, write the name of the app and/or change the order of the menu. To do this, create a `.config` file inside your `docs directory`.

```json
{
  "name": "âš¡ Static Docs",
  "menu": [
    "index.mdx",
    {
      "name": "Github",
      "icon": {
        "dark": "assets/github-icon-dark.svg",
        "light": "assets/github-icon-light.svg"
      },
      "to": "https://github.com/Maycon-Santos/static-doc"
    }
  ]
}
```
